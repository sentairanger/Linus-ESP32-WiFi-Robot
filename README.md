# Linus-ESP32-WiFi-Robot


## Introduction

This project is different from ![this](https://github.com/sentairanger/Linus-ESP32-AP-Bot) as that previous project treated Linus as an access point. This project treats Linus as a station where it accesses WiFi similar to a phone or tablet.

## Getting Started

To get started follow ![this](https://dronebotworkshop.com/esp32-servo/) tutorial to add your ESP32 to the Arduino IDE. This will work with the IDE 2.0. After that use the IDE to open either folder. The first folder enables robot control with a touch screen whereas the second folder enables traditional keyboard control. Upload the code and then use the Serial Monitor to check to make sure that the Robot is given an IP address. Then, go to a browser and the app should appear. Move the slider to control the speed of the motors. Use the buttons to move the robot or blink the LED.
